# STS servo documentation and register list

These files were provided to me by Feetech, who kindly allowed me to repost them. They specify how to communicate with their servos:

 - Feetech-CommunicationProtocole: specified the protocole used for communication, generic for all Feetech servos
 - STS3215 Memory Table: Register mapping for the STS 3215 servo.
